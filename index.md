# Api Challenge

## Project Goals:

### Part 1: WeatherPy
  - Using OpenAPIWeatherMap, randomly select 500 cities and pull the data into a dataframe.
  - Graph the following:
  
   1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
   2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
   3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
   4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

- Then separate those graphs by hemisphere to analyze trends.
- 
### Part 2: VacationPy

- Next, filter the results of part one to find the perfect weather destinations. 
- Note, perfect weather specifications are as follows:
  1. A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
  2. Wind speed less than 10 mph.
  3. Zero cloudiness.

- Using Google Places APIs and the coordinates of

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/efennie/python-api-challenge/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
